To create the backend for the website, you can break down the functionality into different modules. Here are the modules you might need:

1. User Authentication: This module handles user registration and login functionality for both students and landlords. It ensures that only registered users can access specific features.

2. Properties: This module allows landlords to add, edit, and delete properties. It includes functionality to add property details such as location, price, amenities, and property pictures.

3. Booking: This module allows students to search for available properties based on their preferences (e.g., location, price range, amenities) and book a property if it meets their requirements. It manages the booking process, including checking availability and generating booking confirmation.

4. Reviews and Ratings: This module enables students to provide feedback and ratings for the properties they have rented. It allows them to view reviews and ratings submitted by other students to make informed decisions.

5. Search and Filtering: This module provides students with the ability to search for properties based on different criteria (e.g., location, price range, amenities). It includes functionality to filter search results based on specific preferences.

6. Messaging: This module facilitates communication between students and landlords. It allows students to send inquiries or messages to landlords regarding specific properties, and landlords can respond to these inquiries.

7. Notifications: This module sends notifications to users regarding updates and important information related to their bookings, inquiries, or any other relevant activities.

These modules cover the main features required for your website. However, the actual number of modules and their specific functionalities may vary based on your exact requirements.
